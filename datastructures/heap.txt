A heap is a variant of a tree which partially orders elements by size. Heaps are
organized as trees, with all children of any node being either greater (min heap) 
or less (max heap) than their parent nodes. Heaps can be any kind of tree, but are
usually binary.

NB: heaps are a good way to implement a priority queue

Heap functions:

insert   O(log n)
peek max O(1)
peek min 
pop max O(1)
pop min 


c++ has some heap functions:
int std::algorithm, you can use std::make_heap(v.begin(), v.end()) to make a vector a heap.
you can also std::push_heap(v.begin(), v.end()) to heapify after adding an element.

you can then sort the heap using:
std::sort_heap(v.begin(), v.end());

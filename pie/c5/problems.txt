1: find the height of a binary tree
2: do a preorder traversal
3: perform a preorder traversal without recursion
4: find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree given two nodes
5: given an unordered binary tree of integers, turn that into a heap made of a balanced binary tree
6: given an unbalanced BST with more nodes on the left than the right, reorganize the tree to improve its balance while keeping it a BST
7: six degrees of kevin bacon

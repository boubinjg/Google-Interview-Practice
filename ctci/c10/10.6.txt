imagine you have a 20GB file with 1 string per line. How would you sort this file?

Assumptions: unique strings, order is alphabetical (AA comes before AB, AB comes before ABA)
	     20GB of storage other than the file

You could search through the file in blocks, separating words by first letter. create N other files,
one for each starting character. sort each file. write each file in order to the new file.


//the book says:

do the above but dont create new files. load it in in pieces and save each piece to the new file.
Then merge the new file.

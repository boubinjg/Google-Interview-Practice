given an input file with 4B non-negative ints, find the missing int in the interval. 

4b ints is a lot to store in memory, but you can make a bool array which is .5GB total.
You can flip each bit corresponding to the number given and then search linearly to find the bit that was
not flipped.

Do the same thing but with 1b ints and 10mb of memory:

We need to look through the thing twice. First time,
keep a 1000000 long array of ints. When you pass a value (ex 15),
find its block (for 15 this would be 0, or n/1000000), and increment the count for that block.

When you are done looking at the array, find the block which has a low count.

Then search that block using the bool vector.

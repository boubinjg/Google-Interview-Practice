we have a method canMoveTo(x,y) which tests if a chess piece can move to a specific position.
How would you test this?

cases:

correct use:
	for each piece type (rook, queen, bishop...) see if they can move to valid empty squares
	as above, see if each piece type can move to occupied squares (takes)
	
	check, en passant, pawn pushing

incorrect use:
	for each piece type, see if a piece can move to a square which is blocked (piece in its path)
		^ blocked by an enemy piece or friendly piece

	see if a piece can move to a square outside of the bounds of the board (greater than 7 less than 0)
	
	see if a piece can move out of blocking check

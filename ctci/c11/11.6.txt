How would you test an ATM:

who uses ATMs?
customers attempting to withdraw money
maintenance workers adding money/fixing the machine
can you deposit? no

what do they do with the machine?:
customers:
	insert card
	type in pin
	select money to withdraw
	atm provides money
	money is removed from users account

when can the machine break?
crushing/bludgeoning/piercing from someone trying to steal money
software failure
bad weather/water damage/extreme high temperatures

how can an atm fail gracefully?:
software failure should not spit out money
should be reasonably resistant to attempts to open it unlawfully

how can an ATM fail incorrectly:
double charge customers
give customers more money than they can withdraw (over limit or over bank account value)
charge the wrong account

test for these cases by creating machines to break/test atms physically

design software to make withdrawls which are invalid.

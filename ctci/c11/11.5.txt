How would you test a pen?

Who uses pens?
students/teachers/office workers/home users
artists

What do they use pens for?

writing informal notes
art
signing/filling out important documents, taking tests

what must pens do?
write ink in an unbroken line
ink must dry in a reasonable time to prevent streaking
(assumption) retract their point
allow for disassembly to add ink cartridges 

When can pens break?
when they are stepped on, sat on too vigorusly, 
crushed by other means
when they are bent to an extreme
outside of a reasonable temperature range, ink may boil or freeze

how does a pen break well?
a pen must not shatter and hurt its user when broken.
if it breaks, its jagged edges should not be sharp enough to break skin
its ink cartridge should not break
ink should be washable incase the cartridge does break. 

How to test the pen:

What pens do:
create a machine to draw unbroken lines for a large amount of time to see if the pen
continues writing, and to see if the pen runs out of ink

test drying by using a machine to write a line then attempt to streak the line

create a machine to "click" the pen thousands of times to test point retraction

create a machine that repeatedly disassembles and reassembles a pen with new ink cartridges
and tests the new cartridge

how pens break:

crush thousands of pens to see if:
	ink cartridge breaks,
	pen shatters into dangerous shrapnal
			

test pens at reasonable/unreasonable temperatures
test ink for toxicity/washability

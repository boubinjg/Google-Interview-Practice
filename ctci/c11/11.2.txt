re given the source to an application which crashes when run. after checking in a debugger,
it never crashes in the same place. the application is single threaded and uses only the c stl.
what programming errors could cause the crash. how would you test them?

accessing memory outside of a programs virtual address space
(segfault)

null pointer exception

array index out of bounds (kind of like the first one)

stack overflow



How could these be caused?:
vector resizing while being accessed (such as in a loop)

stack being too small for recursive operations

memory leaks 

other issues:
randomness, such as use input, time of day input, or random numbers which
crash the system

uninitialized variables. If the system does not initialize all variables,
this could lead to crashing.

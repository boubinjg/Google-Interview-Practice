in c++ maps work sort of like hashtables, they take a key and a value and map values to some 
position in an associative array. 

in an map, elements have a specific order, in a general hashtable, order is not necessary. 
Maps do not allow elements to have similar keys, like a hashtable would.

Maps, unlike hash tables which would usually exist in an array, are red black trees 
unordered_map is an associative array such as a hash table. Map's ordered quality, imposed by its underlying
data structure, differs from a usual hashtable implementation.

Map, like a hashtable, allows for in place modification. 

Maps are logn lookup, and insertion. 

hashtables should be constant lookup and insertion.

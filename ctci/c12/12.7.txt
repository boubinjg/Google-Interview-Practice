why does a destructor in a base class need to be virtual

If the destructor is not virtual, only the base object will be deleted.
If you delete a derived class object through a pointer to its base class,
only the base class elements will be deleted. this creates a resource leak.

If elements are not deleted polymorphically (as pointers to a base class)
making the destructor virtual is not necessary, but seems to be heavily suggested.

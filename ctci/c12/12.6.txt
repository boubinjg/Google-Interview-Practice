in c, what does the volitile keyword do?

The volitile keyword tells the compiler not to optimize anything to do with the volitile variable.

Compilers can use optimization techniques to change when certain instructions are executed.
This is usually ok, unless we are interfacing with hardware directly mapped to a memory address
which we are trying to put commands for that hardware into. If the compiler optimizes in such a way
that the memory address contains different values at different times then when we intended,
this can cause problems. 

One good example of when a compiler might mess things up is when a loop control variable
is not modified in a loop body. Even if the variable is modified by the operating system or 
some other hardware device, the compiler will get rid of it to optimize, assuming the loop is infinite.

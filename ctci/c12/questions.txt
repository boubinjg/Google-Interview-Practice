1 write a method to print the last k lines of an input file using c++

2 implement a function void reverse(char* str) in c++ which reverses a null-terminated string

3 compare and contrast hash tables and stl map, which works better on a small input

4 how do virtual functions work in c++

5 what is the difference between deep and shallow copy

6 what is the significance of the keyword volitile in c

7 why does a destructor in base class need to be declared virtual

8 write a method that takes a pointer to a Node struct as a parameter and returns
a complete copy of the passed in data structure. node contains two pointers to other nodes (Binary Tree)

9 write a smart pointer class: a class that uses templates to simulate a pointer and also has
automatic garbage collection. 

10 write an alligned malloc and free function that supports allocating memory such that the memory
address returned is divisible by a specific power of two.

11 write a function in C called 2Dalloc which allocates a two dimensional array.
minimise the number of calls to malloc and make sure that the memory is accessable
by the notation arr[i][j].
